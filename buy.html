    <p>Ready to make your order? You may notice that there is no links to your cart, no checkout, and nowhere to give us your credit card. This is because of our revolutionary new and experimental purchase system. Just ask a cracked mirror for the item you wish to purchase. We don't use money here, so this will open negotiations for something of value you wish to trade. conform your purchase with your name of names. Delivery will happen. You will recive a the product or something close. No returns. For complaints, don't.</p>
